# finalProject

* Project Outline

## The interface page of this project is going to begin with some user creativity, allowing the user to freely choose their colour palatte preference and fonts, using JavaScript to render the chosen font and colour in “YOUR TEXT” section. User can then hit continue to the next page. The theme of this project is drawing on the web using squares and rectangles, representing buildings – a real estate project. The second page includes a rotating self-drawn 3D cube(s), “building(s)”, using WebGL, which will take up the entire page. The following page is drawing in HTML canvas of city skyline, and since several rectanges will be drawn, I will use functions and variables to automate the process to reduce the need to repeat the same code. An additional consideration will be to animate this drawing in “square” windows, creating a more realistic skyline effect. The final page is going to utilise CSS animation to allow auto scroll the “team” and “projects” section, with the option for user to play and stop, depending on how the informational content will be displayed. Project ends at the “Contact Us” section with an SVG created logo/sign related to the project.
